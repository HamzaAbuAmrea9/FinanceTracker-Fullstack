## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### **Prerequisites**

*   [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
*   [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
*   A running instance of [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) (or use a tool like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)).
*   An IDE like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
*   An Android Emulator or a physical device.

### **Backend Setup**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HamzaAbuAmrea9/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name/backend
    ```
2.  **Create the Database:**
    *   In your MySQL instance, create a new, empty database named `financetracker_db`.
3.  **Configure the Connection:**
    *   Open `appsettings.json`.
    *   Update the `DefaultConnection` string with your MySQL username and password.
    *   Update the `AppSettings:Token` with your own long, secret key for JWT signing.
4.  **Run Migrations:**
    *   This will create all the necessary tables in your database.
    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update
    ```
5.  **Run the Backend:**
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
    The API will now be running, typically on `https://localhost:7014` and `http://localhost:5146`.

### **Frontend Setup**

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend 
    ```
2.  **Get Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
3.  **Configure the API URL:**
    *   Open `lib/api/api_service.dart`.
    *   Find the `_baseUrl` constant.
    *   If using an Android Emulator, the address `http://10.0.2.2:5146` or `https://10.0.2.2:7014` should work.
    *   If using a physical device, replace `10.0.2.2` with your computer's local IPv4 address (find it with `ipconfig` or `ifconfig`).
4.  **Run the App:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
